I will put the codes I practice for networkx here.

someproperties_20170725_a.py

In this file, I try to compute some properties of a connected graph without the using of pathlengths function in networkx, like the shortest path between any two nodes of the graph with the aid of BSF algorithm. Other properties like the number of the shortest path of any two nodes, the diameter of the graph, and the average path are shown in this file.
