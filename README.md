I will put the codes I practice for networkx here.


someproperties_20170725_a.py

In this file, I try to compute some properties of a connected graph without the using of the helping function in networkx, like the shortest path between any two nodes of the graph with the aid of BSF algorithm. Other properties like the number of the shortest path of any two nodes, the diameter of the graph, and the average path are shown in this file.
For a deeper look, you can refer to https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/examples/basic/properties.html


findcomponent_20170726.py

This program shows how to divide disconnected components of a graph into separate subgraphs using BSF algorithm.  


complexity_20170728.py

This program computes the number of spanning trees of a graph, which is also called complexity based on Kirchhoff's Matrix-tree Theorem.

simplegraph_20170729.py

This program shows a simple example to detect whether a graph is simple.
